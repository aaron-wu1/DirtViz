# DirtViz API

## Introduction

The DirtViz api is built using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) factory app pattern. All modules revolve around the running Flask context. 

## API Reference

The DirtViz API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). The API uses predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The DirtViz API doesnâ€™t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request. I.e., one data point can be updated per request.

## Authentication

The DirtViz platform handles users authentication using a [refresh token flow](https://cloudentity.com/developers/basics/oauth-grant-types/refresh-token-flow/). Users are given an access token to the API and a refresh token to designate access time. Currently, still under construction

For external devices DirtViz plans utilize API Keys to authenticate requests

The authentication module is located under `auth`

## Resources

DirtViz utilizes [flaskRESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to abstract construction of a REST Api. Endpoints are imported into the app when the app is created and are stored under the `resources` folder

Resource authentication is handled by utilzing a [resource decorator](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#declaring-schemas) to control access to an endpoint

## Validation

For validatiaon, DirtViz utilizes [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to check if the request is formmated correctly and with the correct types. [Schemas](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#declaring-schemas) are created under the `schemas` folder and imported into various resources as needed.

## Async Workers

To handle long running tasks, DirtViz uses [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) as a task queue and [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a message broker. A Celery worker configuration is handled under `backend/__init__.py` and is built under a seperate flag in the dockerfile named, prodworker and devworker.

## Testing

Testing is conducted using [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) and [testing fixtures](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/testing/) are spun up within the factory app pattern.

## Build

For development builds, Fl

## Production

To support the demands of deployment, DirtViz utilizes [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) as a WSGI HTTP server. The configuration is located at `gunicorn.conf.py`. Gunicorn workers at set to scale according to `CPU_COUNT * 2 + 1` as per [gunicorn docs](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html#how-many-workers). Monkey patching is also done for performace, which is patched before gunicorn. **Note: additional librarys need monkey patching support or you may encounter unintended errors**
